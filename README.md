The tools that I was using were Jupyter Notebook and Python (Pandas and Matplotlib). I was able to gain three perspective of insights from the raw data.
 ### 
    1. Customer perspective
    2. Driver/Dasher perspective
    3. Restaurant perpective.

## Customer Perspective

I used horizontal bar graph to find out the customer trend when choosing either ASAP or Scheduled Later. the graph below shows that customers is tends to choose ASAP to order their food. At the same time, we can also see that 'Palo Alto' has the highest number of orders compared to other regions.

## Driver/ Dasher Perspective
 I used a scatter plot to find out if Order total ($) affecting how customer tipping the driver or not.
 The plot below shows that customers who placed order up to $100 mostly tip the driver around $0 to $10. For customer who bought food more than $100 tends to to tip $5 to $20. In conclusion, we can see that the tips are affected not much by the Order Total ($).

 The next analysis is to find the top 10 dasher that earn the most tips. As we can see from the table and the bar graph, driver #195 has the highest earning. Doordash can use this information to convince the other new driver that they can also earn this much every month. The information shows that the drivers are able to receive extra cash very month from tip alone, and this means that it can help to increase driver retention rate.

## Restaurant Perspective
I used the same approach again here for the first bar graph for the restaurant. Finding the 10 highest Order total ($).
As you can see, restuarant #9 is on the 1st place, The restaurant #9 earned a total of $39,374 in a month before tax and fee.
I believe Doordash can focus on these top 10 restaurant and partner up with these top performance restaurant. I can say that by doing this we can see it can bring benefits to both sides.

Another perspective that we can take a look at is focusing on the regions that has highest sales or order totals ($). Below is a pie chart that shows 'Palo Alto' is rank #1.
