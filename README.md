# DoorDash-Interview-Assement
This Cavin's GitHub repository that contains a technical interview assesment that is given by Doordash.

The tools that I was using were Jupyter Notebook and Python (Pandas and Matplotlib). I was able to gain three perspective of insights from the raw data.
The first is the customer perspective, the second is the driver/ dasher perspective, and third is the restaurant perpective.

## Customer Perspective
 
## Driver/ Dasher Perspective
 I used a scatter plot to find out if Order total ($) affecting how customer tipping the driver or not.
 The plot below shows that customers who placed order up to $100 mostly tip the driver around $0 to $10. For customer who bought food more than $100 tends to to tip $5 to $20. In conclusion, we can see that the tips are affected not much by the Order Total ($).

 The next analysis is to find the top 10 dasher that earn the most tips. As we can see from the table and the bar graph, driver 195 has the highest earning. Doordash can use this information to convince the other new driver that they can also earn this much every month. The driver may able to received extra cash very month, it can increase driver retention rate.
